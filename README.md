### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/vivek-163/Chat-with-SQL-database.git  
   cd Chat-with-SQL-database  

2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:  
   Ensure you have `pip` installed, then run:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. Obtain your GROQ API key:  
   - Visit [Groq Cloud Platform](https://cloud.groq.com).  
   - Sign up or log in.  
   - Navigate to the **API Keys** section in the dashboard.  
   - Generate and copy your API key.  

4. Set the GROQ API key as an environment variable:  
   On **macOS/Linux**:  
   ```bash  
   export GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'  
   ```  
   On **Windows** (Command Prompt):  
   ```bash  
   set GROQ_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'  
   ```  

5. Run the application:

## Usage  
1. Open the application in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).  
2. Connect your SQL database by entering the **hostname**, **username**, **password**, and **database name** in the provided fields.  
3. Begin typing natural language queries in the chatbot interface. Examples:  
   - *"Show all orders from last week."*  
   - *"Insert a new employee into the database with name 'John' and salary '50000'."*  
4. Review the SQL query generated by the chatbot, modify it if needed, and execute it.  
5. View query results in a table format or download them as CSV for further analysis.
